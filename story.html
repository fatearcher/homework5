                <p>In 2067,crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival. Corn is the last viable crop.
                    The world has also regressed into a post-truth society where younger generations are taught ideas
                    such as the Apollo moon missions were faked. Widowed engineer and former NASA pilot Joseph Cooper is
                    now a farmer. Living with him are his father-in-law, Donald; his 15-year-old son, Tom Cooper, and
                    10-year-old daughter, Murphy "Murph" Cooper. After a dust storm, strange dust patterns inexplicably
                    appear on Murphy's bedroom floor; she attributes the anomaly to a ghost. Cooper eventually deduces
                    the patterns were caused by gravity variations and that they are a binary code for geographic
                    coordinates. Cooper follows the coordinates to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John
                    Brand, Cooper's former supervisor. Professor Brand says gravitational anomalies have happened
                    elsewhere. 48 years earlier, unknown beings positioned a wormhole near Saturn, opening a path to a
                    distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable worlds located near a black hole named Gargantua.
                    Twelve volunteers traveled through the wormhole to individually survey the planets. Astronauts
                    Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reported positive results. Based on their data, Professor Brand conceived
                    two plans to ensure humanity's survival. Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion
                    theory to propel colonies into space, while Plan B involves launching the Endurance spacecraft
                    carrying 5,000 frozen human embryos to colonize a habitable planet.

                    Cooper is recruited to pilot the Endurance. The crew includes scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor
                    Brand's daughter), Dr. Romilly, Dr. Doyle, and robots TARS and CASE. Before leaving, Cooper gives a
                    distraught Murphy his wristwatch to compare their relative time for when he returns. After
                    traversing the wormhole, Romilly studies the black hole while Cooper, Doyle, and Brand descend in a
                    landing craft to investigate Miller's planet, an ocean world. After finding wreckage from Miller's
                    ship, a gigantic tidal wave kills Doyle and delays the lander's departure. Due to the proximity of
                    the black hole, time is severely
                    the black hole, time is severely dilated: as a result, 23 years have
                    elapsed for Romilly on
                    Endurance by the time Cooper and Brand return.

                    Edmunds' planet has slightly better telemetry, while Mann broadcasts positive data. Cooper rules
                    to
                    use their remaining fuel to reach Mann's planet. On Mann's planet, the Endurance crew revive him
                    from cryostasis. Meanwhile, Murph, now a scientist, transmits a message announcing Professor
                    Brand
                    has died. She has learned that Plan A, requiring unattainable data from within a black hole, was
                    never viable. Plan B was always Professor Brand's only option. Murphy accuses Brand and Cooper
                    of
                    knowing those left on Earth were doomed. Mann's frozen planet is uninhabitable; he had sent
                    falsified data in order to be rescued. Mann attempts to murder Cooper, then escapes in a lander
                    and
                    heads for Endurance. Romilly is killed by Mann's booby trap and Brand and Cooper race to the
                    Endurance in another lander. Mann dies during a failed manual docking operation, severely
                    damaging
                    Endurance. After a difficult docking maneuver, Cooper regains control of the damaged but
                    functional
                    Endurance.

                    Miller's planet orbiting Gargantua
                    With insufficient fuel to reach Edmunds' planet, they use a slingshot maneuver so close to
                    Gargantua
                    that time dilation adds another 51 years. In the process, Cooper and TARS jettison themselves to
                    shed weight and ensure Endurance reaches Edmunds' planet. Slipping through the event horizon of
                    Gargantua, they eject from their respective craft and find themselves inside a massive
                    tesseract,
                    constructed by future humans. Across different time periods, Cooper can see through the
                    bookcases of
                    Murphy's old room on Earth and weakly interact with its gravity. Cooper realizes he was Murphy's
                    "ghost" and manipulates the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her, using Morse code to
                    transmit
                    the quantum data that TARS collected from inside the event horizon. Cooper and TARS are ejected
                    from
                    the tesseract. Cooper is picked up and awakens on a space habitat orbiting Saturn, where he
                    reunites
                    with an elderly Murphy. Using the quantum data sent by Cooper, the younger Murphy had solved the
                    gravitational propulsion theory for Plan A, enabling humanity's exodus and survival. Nearing
                    death
                    and with her own family, Murphy urges Cooper to return to Brand. Cooper and TARS take a
                    spacecraft
                    to rejoin Brand and CASE on Edmunds' habitable planet.
